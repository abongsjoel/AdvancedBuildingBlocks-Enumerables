# AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables

> This project is an implementation of a new version of Ruby enumerable methods. I also worked with Joel to incorporate some testing at the end of the project using Rspec.

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started
- Open CMD
- Git clone https://github.com/marilirulita/AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables.git
- Make sure Ruby is installed on your computer

## Testing with Rspec

This project is tested with Rspec which is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in the Ruby programming language

## How to get Rspec Running

- Run the following command in the terminal
  ```
  gem install rspec
  ```
- This command installs Rspec on your computer. You ensure that Rspec is installed by running the following     command to see the installed version
  ```
  rspec --version
  ```
- You should get output similar to the following:
  ```
  RSpec 3.10
    - rspec-core 3.10.1
    - rspec-expectations 3.10.1
    - rspec-mocks 3.10.2
    - rspec-support 3.10.2
  ```
  The rspec gem comes packed with all we need to get started including the 5 gems listed above.

- Navigagte into the AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables folder
  ```
  cd AdvancedBuildingBlocks-Enumerables
  ```
- Run the following command to initialize Rspec
  ```
  rspec --init
  ```
- This generates a /spec folder and a .rspec file at the root of your project

- Finally, to run the tests, simple run:
  ```
  rspec
  ```
